# Genetic Phrase Guesser

This is a simple project I did overnight as an attempt to learn a bit about genetic algorithms. I might be too excited about something so simple but seeing a machine learn on its own is pretty fun, so I'm planning to fix a list of things here, and then jump straight to giving it a neat look via CSS or something.

### The algorithm currently does:

1. match any phrase you type in the input field after you click the **Go!** button;
1.5. as long as it's no longer than around 30 symbols;
2. support uppercase, lowercase, special characters (#, $, %, ^ etc);
3. not support ' or ".

### To do:
* Fix stack overflow;
* Add ' and " support, probably;
* Optimize the code;
* Give the good boy a better look.
